ANDY
=======

Meet Andy, a multi-purpose humanoid robot built with a Raspberry Pi and a robosapien toy. Andy can walk, pick up and set down objects, take pictures, record video, and answer questions. Andy is voice controlled, so there is no need for a computer or smart phone to send him commands. Just say "Andy" wait for the beep, say your command, and Andy will do the rest.

Hardware
========

Andy is built out of inexpencive hardware, so no need for pocket loads of cash. A Robosapien is used for the body, making it easy to use and light in maintainance. A Raspberry Pi is the brain of Andy, making him a very intelligent machine. A cheap USB microphone is plugged into the Raspberry Pi's USB socket giving Andy ears. L298N and L293D motor drivers are used to control Andy's motors, and a MCP23017 chip is used to give the Raspberry Pi more General Purpose Input and Output ports (GPIO). Andy has vision with a Raspberry Pi SPI camera. With all of this powerful hardware, it makes a toy robot a very useful helper.

Software
========

Andy uses many different software packages to operate. Pocketsphinx is used for speech recognition, OpenCV is used for the vision, MySQL is used for Andy's database, and Python is used to combine everything together.
