Cyclops
=======

Cyclops is a multi purpose biped robot made from a <a href="http://www.wowwee.com/en/products/toys/robots/robotics/robosapiens/robosapien">Robosapien</a> shell. Cyclops is powered by a Raspberry Pi. Cyclops has the Pi Camera for a eye, hence the Cyclops name. The camera can stream video to a webserver, and email pictures. A microphone records a command which are converted to text, then Cyclops executes the command. Cyclops can execute over 100 different commands. Not only can Cyclops excute commands by voice, he also has a advanced artificial intelligence. 

Commands
========

Cyclops can execute over 100 different seqences, But has ten keywords he responds to. To get Cyclops to respond to a command, first say "Cyclops" followed by the command. 

<h2>Cyclops, Walk</h2>

The first command is walk. After the walk command, you must tell Cyclops direction and distance. For example: "Cyclops walk forward 10 steps" will make cyclops walk forward ten steps. If you leave out the "steps" he will still walk forward ten steps. If you leave out the 10, Cyclops will walk forward until you give the stop command. The other direction commands are backward, left, and right.

<h2>Cyclops, What</h2>

"What" is a basic command. Using the what command, you can ask Cyclops basic questions like "Cyclops, what is you name?" or "Cyclops, what time is it?" or even "Cyclops, what is 5+13x43?" "What" commands are preprogrammed so you can't just ask Cyclops anything.

<h2>Cyclops, take</h2>
The "take" command is for the camera. There are two commands: "Cyclops, take picture", and "Cyclops take video". Take picture will just take a snapshot right from the current view. With take video, it will start the video and record.
